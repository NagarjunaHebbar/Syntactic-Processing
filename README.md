# Problem Statement
In this assignment, you need to modify the Viterbi algorithm to solve the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques. Though there could be multiple ways to solve this problem, you may use the following hints:

Which tag class do you think most unknown words belong to? Can you identify rules (e.g. based on morphological cues) that can be used to tag unknown words? You may define separate python functions to exploit these rules so that they work in tandem with the original Viterbi algorithm.
Why does the Viterbi algorithm choose a random tag on encountering an unknown word? Can you modify the Viterbi algorithm so that it considers only one of the transition or emission probabilities for unknown words?

# Goals
You can split the Treebank dataset into train and validation sets. Please use a sample size of 95:5 for training: validation sets, i.e. keep the validation size small, else the algorithm will need a very high amount of runtime.

 

# You need to accomplish the following in this assignment:

Write the vanilla Viterbi algorithm for assigning POS tags (i.e. without dealing with unknown words) 
Solve the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques. These techniques can use any of the approaches discussed in the class - lexicon, rule-based, probabilistic etc. Note that to implement these techniques, you can either write separate functions and call them from the main Viterbi algorithm, or modify the Viterbi algorithm, or both.
Compare the tagging accuracy after making these modifications with the vanilla Viterbi algorithm.
List down at least three cases from the sample test file (i.e. unknown word-tag pairs) which were incorrectly tagged by the original Viterbi POS tagger and got corrected after your modifications.
